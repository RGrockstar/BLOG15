            </h5>
            <p>Inter-house football competitions are held frequently in school where there are house teams made and all rules set have to be followed. Children play football like normal and there is a color coded coin spinned to choose the teams amongst the four houses. After that, two-two teams each play against each other. This will inculcate all the four houses all at once. Lastly, the teams that won will have a match together to find the first and second place. Similarly, the teams that lost will have a match together to figure out the third and fourth place. Medals or Trophies are given to winners in the whole school assembly coming up after the competition is over. This competition takes place in the P.E. lesson for each grade.</p>
